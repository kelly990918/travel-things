**Author:** 日向夏 (Natsu Hyuuga)
**Genre:** Mystery, romance
**Overview:** The _Apothecary Diaries_ is a historical mystery series set in a fictional empire modeled after Imperial China. The story centers on Maomao, a 17-year-old apothecary raised by her father, Luomen, in a red-light district. Kidnapped and sold into servitude at the emperor’s rear palace (hougong), a complex housing the emperor’s consorts and servants, Maomao uses her wit, medical expertise, and curiosity to solve medical and political mysteries. Her interactions with Jinshi, a high-ranking eunuch with hidden depths, drive much of the narrative, blending palace intrigue, character-driven drama, and a touch of romance.
