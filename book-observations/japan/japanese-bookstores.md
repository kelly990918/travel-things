## Fiction

#### Small books

Look at the size of the fiction books—they are small as pocket books!
  


#### Where are the English books?
![Fiction in English](/book-observations/japan/english-fiction.jpeg "Fiction in English")
I had a hard time looking for the English shelf in the bookstores, as they are all in the corners. The English fiction books that they import (as I observed) are all paperbacks, and there are not much choice for them.

But I saw quite a lot of translated books. In Japan there are fewer proficient English speakers, even in tourist spots. I guess this is because their own market is strong enough that they don't have to depend on the foreign market, so learning a foreign language is not necessary for them.

#### The Empyrean
![Japanese version of Iron Flame](/book-observations/japan/empyrean1.jpeg "Iron Flame in Japanese")

The Empyrean series seems to do very well in Japan! _Fourth Wing_ has got the first place in translated fiction awards, and they got a lot of shelf space in all of the stores I visited.

![Iron Flame in 2 volumes](/book-observations/japan/iron-flame.jpeg "2 volumeso of Iron Flame")
They separated Iron Flame into 2 books, probably because it'd be too thick after translation! (the book is small)

![The English Empyrean series](/book-observations/japan/empyrean-eng.jpeg "English Empyrean series")
The bookstores also imported the English version, but I could only see paperback version and without the sprayed edges.

## Nonfiction

#### English with Kuromi
![Kuromi-themed junior high English vocab book](/book-observations/japan/english-kuromi.jpeg "Vocab with Kuromi")
This is a Japanese junior high level English vocab book. I guess the character makes language learning more interesting?

#### Red Books（赤本）
![Red books](/book-observations/japan/red-books.jpeg "Red books")
The "red books" are the past papers for university entrance exams. Each book represent one major in a university in Japan. What a stressful shelf of books.
